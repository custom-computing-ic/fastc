\section{Future Work}

\emph{Extending the approach to other classes of parallel
  computation}.  Based on the evaluation results, I will investigate
extending the approach to support the generation of aspect
descriptions for additional classes of parallel computation such as
Sparse or Dense Linear Algebra, MapReduce or N-Body Simulation which
are quintessential examples of parallel kernels
\cite{Asanovic:Bodik:Catanzaro:Gebis:Husbands:Keutzer:Patterson:Plishker:Shalf:Williams:Yelick:2006}. This
step could also provide valuable feedback which can be used to refine
and validate the proposed approach.
