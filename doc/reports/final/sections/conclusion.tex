\emph{Extending the approach to other classes of parallel
  computation}.  Based on the evaluation results, I will investigate
extending the approach to support the generation of aspect
descriptions for additional classes of parallel computation such as
Sparse or Dense Linear Algebra, MapReduce or N-Body Simulation which
are quintessential examples of parallel kernels
\cite{Asanovic:Bodik:Catanzaro:Gebis:Husbands:Keutzer:Patterson:Plishker:Shalf:Williams:Yelick:2006}. This
step could also provide valuable feedback which can be used to refine
and validate the proposed approach.

\emph{Support MaxCompiler 2013.1}. MaxCompiler 2013.1 introduces a new
interface and interesting opportunities for optimisations. It
introduces the possibility to control groups of DFEs and.

\emph{Support a standardise set of pragams} such as OpenACC.

\emph{Extension to heterogeneous systems}. Apart from including
specific support for reconfiguration our approach is intentionally
platform agnostic to allow extension to other platforms for dataflow
computing (such as CPU and GPGPUs).

\emph{Extension to applications in other areas of finance}
Current and future work includes aspect descriptions and the related
facilities that cover systems with different types of accelerators,
and their optimisation. Our approach can also be extended to cover
systematic development of aspect descriptions for optimising a variety
of application domains, from Monte-Carlo simulations in
finance~\cite{Jin:2012} to genetic sequence
matching~\cite{Arram:2013}.
