\begin{abstract}
  We propose a novel design flow for generating dataflow designs based
  on Aspect-oriented programming. We propose to decouple design
  optimisation from design specification by encapsulating
  optimisations in separate aspect descriptions. To support this
  approach we introduce a novel dataflow language that facilitates
  integration with existing aspect weaving tools and simplifies design
  development.
