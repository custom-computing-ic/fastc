This paper describes a novel approach for implementing designs with
run-time reconfiguration on FPGAs using a dataflow approach to
increase performance. We introduce features of the FAST language that
support static reconfiguration in which the partitions are determined
at compilation time. Aspect-driven synthesis is used to generate more
advanced designs that are self-adaptive, being able to choose between
multiple existing configurations to improve performance. We evaluate
our approach by implementing two high-performance designs for Reverse
Time-Migration and Barrier Option pricing.
