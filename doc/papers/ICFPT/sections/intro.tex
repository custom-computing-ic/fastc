\section{Introduction}
We identify the following challenges:
\begin{itemize}
\item supporting run-time reconfiguration in an intutitive and simple
  fashion; current tools require explicit, complicate API calls to achieve
\item supporting self-adaptability in run-time reconfigurable designs;
\end{itemize}

Our contributions include:
\begin{itemize}
\item we introduce and implement extensions/features of the FAST
  language that support static run-time reconfiguration
\item we introduce aspects in LARA that can be used to generate
\end{itemize}
