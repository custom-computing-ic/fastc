% *** Authors should verify (and, if needed, correct) their LaTeX system  ***
% *** with the testflow diagnostic prior to trusting their LaTeX platform ***
% *** with production work. IEEE's font choices can trigger bugs that do  ***

% The testflow support page is at:
% http://www.michaelshell.org/tex/testflow/



% Note that the a4paper option is mainly intended so that authors in
% countries using A4 can easily print to A4 and see how their papers will
% look in print - the typesetting of the document will not typically be
% affected with changes in paper size (but the bottom and side margins will).
% Use the testflow package mentioned above to verify correct handling of
% both paper sizes by the user's LaTeX system.
%
% Also note that the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", option
% should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be displayed in
% draft mode.
%
\documentclass[conference]{IEEEtran}
% Add the compsoc option for Computer Society conferences.
%
% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[conference]{../sty/IEEEtran}





% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found as epslatex.ps or
% epslatex.pdf at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/

\usepackage{listings}


% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/





% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.



%\usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%\usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/



%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/
% Read the url.sty source comments for usage information. Basically,
% \url{my_url_here}.





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\section{Introduction}

 Custom designs on FPGA devices can be used to improve performance and
power consumption of computationally intensive algorithms. However,
creating custom designs is a difficult task and requires detailed
knowledge of circuit design and underlying performance
considerations. Ideally we want to synthesize custom designs from
existing high level implementations in C or other languages without
compromising on performance and energy efficiency.

We propose a compilation flow from high-level C programs to a
streaming dataflow architecture that captures and applies
optimizations using LARA, an aspect oriented programming language for
embedded systems [??]

Our contributions include:
\begin{enumerate}

\item We introduce MaxC, a C based meta-programming language and API
  for specifying dataflow designs;

\item We propose a DSE method based on MaxC and LARA for exploring
  optimizations of streaming data flow kernel designs;

\item We evaluate our approach using it to generate various
  implementations of a high performance application based on the
  Reverse Time Migration (RTM) technique for seismic imaging [??].

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Something about hardware?}

\section{Proposed design flow}

We perform a DSE step until we find a design that fits the chip,
achieves timing closure and meets non functional requirements.  For
each optimization strategy in our repository we:

\begin{enumerate}

\item apply the set of specific low-level optimizations comprised in
  the strategy (e.g. setting DSP balance).

\item  we compile the optimized
  design using the MaxCC backend to MaxJava, Maxeler's own dataflow
  language

\item we start the backend compilation toolchain (MaxCompiler
  and Xilinx) and perform an analysis of the reporting information,
  based on which we either restart the flow with the next optimization
  strategy step or proceed to the next step

\item we measure NFRs such as performance or latency and if our target
  is not met we restart using a different optimization strategy

\end{enumerate}

% An example of a floating figure using the graphicx package.
% Note that \label must occur AFTER (or within) \caption.
% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
%
% Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class
% option should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be
% displayed while in draft mode.
%
%\begin{figure}[!t]
%\centering
%\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{myfigure}
% where an .eps filename suffix will be assumed under latex,
% and a .pdf suffix will be assumed for pdflatex; or what has been declared
% via \DeclareGraphicsExtensions.
%\caption{Simulation Results}
%\label{fig_sim}
%\end{figure}

% Note that IEEE typically puts floats only at the top, even when this
% results in a large percentage of a column being occupied by floats.


% An example of a double column floating figure using two subfigures.
% (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.)
% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command, the
% \label for the overall figure must come after \caption.
% \hfil must be used as a separator to get equal spacing.
% The subfigure.sty package works much the same way, except \subfigure is
% used instead of \subfloat.
%
%\begin{figure*}[!t]
%\centerline{\subfloat[Case I]\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{subfigcase1}%
%\label{fig_first_case}}
%\hfil
%\subfloat[Case II]{\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{subfigcase2}%
%\label{fig_second_case}}}
%\caption{Simulation results}
%\label{fig_sim}
%\end{figure*}
%
% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure
% captions (using the optional argument to \subfloat), but instead will
% reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption.


% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the
% \caption command should come BEFORE the table. Table text will default to
% \footnotesize as IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.
%
%\begin{table}[!t]
%% increase table row spacing, adjust to taste
%\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.3}
% if using array.sty, it might be a good idea to tweak the value of
% \extrarowheight as needed to properly center the text within the cells
%\caption{An Example of a Table}
%\label{table_example}
%\centering
%% Some packages, such as MDW tools, offer better commands for making tables
%% than the plain LaTeX2e tabular which is used here.
%\begin{tabular}{|c||c|}
%\hline
%One & Two\\
%\hline
%Three & Four\\
%\hline
%\end{tabular}
%\end{table}


% Note that IEEE does not put floats in the very first column - or typically
% anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also, in-text middle ("here")
% positioning is not used. Most IEEE journals/conferences use top floats
% exclusively. Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals/conferences, places
% footnotes above bottom floats. This can be corrected via the \fnbelowfloat
% command of the stfloats package.


\section{The  MaxC Language}

MaxC is a programing language and API based on the C99 standard. It
provides a succinct means of specifying dataflow designs and is an
intermediate representation in the proposed design flow. MaxC is a
meta-programming language in the sense that, unlike a regular C
program, a MaxC program is not "executed"" but specifies
a hardware design. MaxC is designed to be human readable and to
facilitate integration with other tools. Being based on the C99
standard, the language interacts well with existing compilers or source
to source translation frameworks (e.g. LARA, ROSE), allowing source
level optimizations to be applied through different tools.

The example below presents a simple kernel performing a 1d
convolution.

Lines 2-6 show the kernel declaration specifying the stream input "p"
and output "out" as well as a number of scalar parameters configurable
at run-time.

On lines 13-16 we use array index notation to access future (positive
offset) or past (negative offset) stream elements.

Normal arithmetic operations can be used to operate on stream
elements.

\lstset{style=MaxC}

\begin{lstlisting}
#pragma stream:result type:uint32 func:kernel_Convolution1d
void kernel_Convolution1d(
  sin_float8_24 p,
  sout_float8_24 out,
  float8_24 c_0_0_0, float8_24 c_p_0_0, float8_24 c_n_0_0,
  uint32 n1, uint32 ORDER)
{
    s_float8_24 i4 = count(1000, 1);
    s_float8_24 i1 = countChain(n1, 1, i4);

    s_int result =
        p[0]  * c_0_0_0 +
        p[1]  * c_p_0_0 +
        p[-1] * c_n_0_0;

    s_bool up = (i1 >= ORDER) && (i1 < n1 - ORDER);
    s_int32 inter = stream_select(up, p, result);

    output_i(out, inter);
}
\end{lstlisting}

The example illustrates the additional types we introduce as
extensions to C99. These are meant to simplify the language and make
it more expressive as well as provide additional verification and
optimisation mechanisms (e.g. type safety). Maintaining compatibility
with C99 simplifies the kernel simulation flow as discussed below.

\section{Implementation}

The MaxCC backend is implemented using the ROSE compiler framework
[@rose00]. It processes the Abstract Syntax Tree generated by the ROSE
frontend into a data flow graph representation of the original MaxC
design. It then traverses this graph in conjunction with the original
AST emitting MaxJava code.

MaxCC supports the following types, as extensions to C99:

\begin{itemize}
\item floati\_j (e.g float8\_24, float10\_22 etc.), uinti/inti
  (e.g. uint32, int32) allow specification of custom width data
  types

\item s\_floati\_j, s\_inti\_j etc. (e.g. s\_float8\_24) allow specification of
  stream data types
\end{itemize}

To allow decoupling of bit width specifications from the functional
code we also provide the type s\_float, s\_int etc. In this
situation we can specify the type using a pragma directive.

The previous example also illustrates some of the MaxC API components:

 * output functions (e.g. output\_i) are used to connect an internal
   kernel stream to the output stream of a kernel

 * various counters and counter chain configurations can be
   instantiated using functions from the counter API as shown on lines
   8-9

 * functions such as stream\_select are used to multiplex between a
   number of streams based on the value of condition stream

\section{Kernel Simulation}

The goal for the kernel simulation model is that it should be possible
to compile and run it using the standard GCC toolchain, verifying the
logical correctness of the design (i.e. not accounting for hardware
effects such as stalls etc.).

To achieve this we provide the type extensions described above as type
definitions. Streams are modelled as pointers: `typedef float*
s\_float8\_24`. After each kernel cycle, stream pointers are
incremented, as shown in the simulation loop below:

\lstset{style=MaxC}

\begin{lstlisting}
for (int i = 0 ; i < CYCLE_COUNT; i++) {
   kernel_Convolution1d(p, out, 2);
   update_stream_pointers(p, out);
}
\end{lstlisting}

The major limitation of this approach is that, due to the lack of
support for polymorphism in C, in order to enable simulation support,
users are required to add boilerplate code, that would otherwise not
be required by the MaxCC backend. When compiling with MaxCC this
boilerplate code is simply ignored, so any mistakes in this code will
not be captured by the simulation model.

This issue is illustrated in the example below where we must use the
`stream\_init\_i(int stream\_id)` function, passing in a unique stream id
to retrieve the appropriate stream values from the global data
structures they are stored in. The function then either allocates a
new stream or increments the stream pointer if the stream has already
been allocated. Furthermore if we extend the example to use two
counters, we similarly require unique identifiers for counters.

\begin{lstlisting}
void kernel_Convolution1d(
    sin_float8_24 in,
    sout_float8_24 out,
    float8_24 c)
{
    float8_24 count = counter(10, 1);

    s_int32 result = stream_init_i(0);
	result[0] = c * (in[0] + in[1]);

    int32 good = (count > 2) && (count < 5);

    int32 inter = stream_selectfi(good, in, result);

    output_i(out, inter);
}

\end{lstlisting}

\section{Connecting Kernels}

We create a simple configuration language for specifying kernel and
host interconnections. The configuration file used for the RTM
application is shown as an example below. This allows us to specify
the kernel instances that form our design. The configuration file has
two parts. First we specify the kernel instances. For example line 3
in the listing below specifies that we will be creating 3 kernel
instances based on a kernel named Cmdread. After specifying all kernel
instances, we can specify the flow of data between kernels, host and
memory. We can specify three types of flow:

* kernel to kernel for example `Myapp0[out] > Myapp1[in]`. This will
  connect the output of Myapp0 named "out" to the input of Myapp1
  named "in";

* memory to kernel, as shown on line 10 in the listing below; this
  will connect a dram stream named "dram2knl0" to the input of Myapp0
  "in"; the read sequence is provided by the output of Cmdread0 named
  dram\_read; we can also specify a kernel to memory direction, as
  shown on line 15 in which case the second argument specifies the
  stream providing the write sequence;

* finally, we can create host to memory and memory to host connections
  as shown on lines 7 - 8.

\lstset{style=MaxCconf}

\begin{lstlisting}
kernels:
  Cmdread:  Cmdread0 Cmdread1 Cmdread2 Cmdread3 Cmdhostread
  Cmdwrite: Cmdwrite0 Cmdwrite1 Cmdhostwrite
  RTM:      MyApp0

flow:
  Host > Memory[dram2mgr, Cmdhostwrite.dram_write]
  Memory[mgr2dram, Cmdhostread.dram_read] > Host

  Memory[dram2knl0, Cmdread0.dram_read] > Myapp0[burst_p]
  Memory[dram2knl1, Cmdread1.dram_read] > Myapp0[burst_pp]
  Memory[dram2knl2, Cmdread2.dram_read] > Myapp0[burst_dvv]
  Memory[dram2knl3, Cmdread3.dram_read] > Myapp0[burst_source]

  MyApp0[ker_p] > Memory[knl2dram0, Cmdwrite0.dram_write]
  MyApp0[output_pp] > Memory[knl2dram1, Cmdwrite1.dram_write]
\end{lstlisting}
