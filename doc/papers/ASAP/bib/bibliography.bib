   abstract        = {Nowadays processing systems are asked to support
                     increasing complex and demanding high-performance
                     applications, especially in the signal processing and
                     video processing domains. The design of these systems
                     are becoming extremely challenging because of several
                     factors. Among them the most relevant are: The advent
                     of the parallel era The sequential general purpose
                     processor era during which performance increased more
                     than two-fold every year, is definitely over. There
                     has been no further increase in leading edge
                     processor performance for over five years now and all
                     projects aimed at breaking the 4 GHz barrier have
                     been canceled by the major processor manufacturers.
                     So as to continue increasing the computing power of
                     computer systems, manufacturers have to use several
                     slower processing cores, while trying to minimize the
                     power consumption. Sequential reference softwares are
                     no longer adapted Up to now, sequential software have
                     proven to be the winning approaches for exploiting
                     the potential of each new generation of sequential
                     processors. But the advent of the new parallel era
                     changes the way systems are implemented and
                     sequential reference software used as specification
                     base are no longer appropriate starting points for
                     designing complex systems. The increasing demanding
                     functionality and performance In parallel with
                     miniaturization and the necessity to handle severely
                     resource-constrained implementation platforms, the
                     functionality and complexity of large classes of
                     systems continue to increase making them from many
                     respects comparable to ordinary desktop personal
                     computers. A mixture of different types of timing and
                     quality constraints make overall system architecture
                     design, resource allocation and scheduling more
                     important and challenging topics than ever before.
                     Additionally, the market asks companies to build
                     efficient systems while using the minimum of
                     resources as fast as possible. Due to the level of
                     complexity reached by high-demanding digital systems,
                     it is no longer reasonable to handle such systems at
                     low levels of abstraction (e.g. VHDL/Verilog or
                     C/C++). A solution to the problem is to higher the
                     level of abstraction at which the design of such
                     systems is performed. But for raising the level of
                     abstraction, the need for portable parallelism is
                     primordial so as to be able to implement all kind of
                     systems on a wide range of target platforms. Thus,
                     enabling portable parallelism should be a primordial
                     requirement for the development of this level of
                     abstraction and the associated methodology and tools.
                     However, creating a new abstraction layer may incur
                     in the risk of loosing contact with implementation
                     details and accuracy necessary for achieving
                     efficient implementations. This work focuses on
                     tackling such problem by using the CAL data flow
                     language as main abstraction at the basis of the
                     design process. The attempt of solving such
                     challenging problem consists in building an
                     environment for enabling high level design space
                     exploration of complex parallel application for
                     seamless implementation on heterogeneous platforms
                     using CAL. It includes the extraction of metrics
                     (static analysis and profiling) with the intention to
                     use them as a basis for partitioning and scheduling
                     heuristics aiming at finding the most efficient
                     partitions. It also implies developing methodologies
                     for guiding designers in the optimization of the high
                     level specifications. Finally, a holistic approach
                     has been defined in form of a complete design flow
                     starting from CAL specifications down to
                     implementations. Where traditional approaches are
                     faced to traverse, at each iteration of the design
                     flow, all the levels of abstraction for testing a
                     design solution, the use of CAL as an abstraction
                     layer enables designers to separate clearly three
                     domains of concerns that are made orthogonal:
                     functionality, partitioning and implementation. The
                     separation of these domains of concerns eases the
                     design space exploration and leads to an increase in
                     productivity in the design of complex systems. This
                     work leads to the creation of several new design
                     tools: (1) profiling tools which extracts metrics
                     from CAL programs and (2) exploration tools which
                     include partitioning and scheduling heuristics and
                     performance evaluation. These tools have been
                     implemented with the aim of guiding designers in the
                     high level design space exploration of systems in
                     order to achieve efficient implementation. A
                     systematic methodology has been also elaborated and
                     has been tested successfully on a real world
                     applications. Thanks to the metrics extracted from
                     the CAL program, the design bottlenecks of a MPEG-4
                     SP video decoder have been identified and removed at
                     a high level of abstraction, leading to improvements
                     up to 7 times faster implementation.},
