\begin{abstract}

 This paper proposes a novel hardware compilation approach targeting
 dataflow designs, based on aspect-oriented programming to decouple
 design development from design optimisation, thus improving
 maintainability, portability and developer productivity while
 enabling automated exploration of design trade-offs that can lead to
 improved performance. We introduce MaxC, a language for specifying
 dataflow designs that supports our approach. Optimisation strategies
 for the generated designs are specified in MaxC, making use of
 facilities in the domain-specific aspect-oriented language, LARA. Our
 approach is demonstrated by various seismic imaging designs for
 Reverse-Time Migration (RTM), which have performance comparable to
 state-of-the-art FPGA implementations while being produced with
 improved developer productivity.
