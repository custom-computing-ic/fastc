\section{Conclusion}

This paper presents a novel development approach for dataflow designs
based on the \MAXC{} language, which supports aspect-driven
compilation. We show that this approach meets the requirements in
performance, portability, integration and productivity. The approach
has been used in producing many optimised designs, including run-time
reconfigurable designs for seismic imaging based on the RTM algorithm
which are over 100 times faster than the corresponding software
versions.

Current and future work includes aspect descriptions and the related
facilities that cover systems with different types of accelerators,
and their optimisation. Our approach can also be extended to cover
systematic development of aspect descriptions for optimising a variety
of application domains, from Monte-Carlo simulations in
finance~\cite{Jin:2012} to genetic sequence
matching~\cite{Arram:2013}.
