\section{Conclusion}

This paper presents a novel development approach for dataflow designs
based on the \MAXC{} language, which supports aspect-driven
compilation. We show that this approach meets the requirements in
performance, portability, integration and productivity. The approach
has been used in producing run-time reconfigurable designs for seismic
imaging based on the RTM algorithm, which are over 100 times faster
than the corresponding software versions. Current and future work
includes aspect descriptions and the required facilities that cover
systems with different types of accelerators, and their optimisation.
