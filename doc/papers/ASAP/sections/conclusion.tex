\section{Conclusion}

In this paper we present an automated design flow for design space
exploration of dataflow designs based on a novel language, MaxC, and
aspect-driven compilation. We show that our approach can be used to
specify high-performance designs which achieve significant speedups of
up to 100X over software only versions by exploiting the run-time
reconfiguration capabilities of FPGAs. This is achieved using an
automated compilation and design space exploration approach that
increases developer productivity and improves design portability by
allowing the optimisation process to be reproduced on other platforms.

Future work includes extending our approach by introducing new system
aspects that guide the translation and optimisation process from
existing C applications to dataflow designs. This includes the
development of system aspects that can be used to explore structural
transformations of the original application that improve parallelism
and computation versus communication ratio. The introduction of these
aspects could lead to a transparent design flow, that does not require
manual development of dataflow designs, greatly simplifying the
translation of existing software applications to high-performance
custom designs.
