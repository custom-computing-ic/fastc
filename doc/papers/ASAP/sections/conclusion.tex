\section{Conclusion}

In this paper we present an automated design flow for design space
exploration of dataflow designs based on a novel language, MaxC, and
aspect-driven compilation. We show that MaxC can be used to specify
dataflow designs for interesting high-performance applications. We
show that by using LARA to implement aspects that encapsulate
structural transformations as well as design level transformations and
development related transformations we can create maintainable and
portable designs, increasing developer productivity.
